When you run f1_seasons.py you will see this output:

    F1 season #2017
    Team: Scuderia Ferrari
        Driver: Kimi Raikkonen
        Driver: Sebastian Vettel
    Team: McLaren F1 Team
        Driver: Fernando Alonso
        Driver: Jenson Button
    Team: Mercedes AMG Petronas Motorsport
        Driver: Lewis Hamilton
        Driver: Valtteri Bottas
    F1 season #2018
    Team: Scuderia Ferrari
        Driver: Kimi Raikkonen
        Driver: Sebastian Vettel
    Team: McLaren F1 Team
        Driver: Fernando Alonso
        Driver: Stoffel Vandoorne
    Team: Mercedes AMG Petronas Motorsport
        Driver: Lewis Hamilton
        Driver: Valtteri Bottas

This is a set of data generated using three calsses:

**`f1_driver.py:`** with just one field this class represent a driver (a pilot).
**`f1_team.py:`** this class combines a team name with its drivers (f1_driver.py).
**`f1_season.py:`** this is the class thats glues all information togheter, with a season year information and the teams that runed in that year, this class represents a F1 season.

You is my guest to suggest another implementation.

To learn about this: 

I will let here a folder called [Soccer](https://github.com/jeanjmichel/LearnPython3-OrientedProgramming/Soccer/) with a code used to explain Python's collections support. Try break it into classes that represents the entities mentionated in this code.

# Enjoy! =)
